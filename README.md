# Graph_algo'

This is a graph based project . Here we are performing the operations on both directed and undirected graph in a single code. In this you can perform the following operations :-

- Bfs Traversal of a Graph.
- Dfs Traversal of a Graph.
- Topological sort of a directed graph.
- Whether there is a cycle in undirected graph or not.
- whether ther is a cycle in directed graph or not.
- Dijiktras algorithm to find the shortest distance to all nodes from the source node.
- Kosaraju's algorithm to find the no of strongly connected components in the graph.
